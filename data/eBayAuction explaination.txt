Title: Competitive auctions on eBay.com

The file eBayAuctions.xls contains information on 1972 auctions transacted on eBay.com during May-June 2004.
The goal is to use these data to build a model that will classify competitive auctions from noncompetitive ones.
A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least two bids placed on the item auctioned.

The data include variables that describe the item (auction category), the seller (his/her eBay rating), 
and the auction terms that the seller selected (auction duration, opening price, currency, day-of-week of auction close). 
In addition, we have the price at which the auction closed. 
The goal is to predict whether or not the auction will be competitive.

Data preprocessing:
Create dummy variables for the categorical predictors.
These include Category (18 categories), Currency (USD, GBP, Euro), EndDay (Monday-Sunday), and Duration (1,3,5,7, or 10 days).
Split the data into training and validation datasets using a 60%:40% ratio.
